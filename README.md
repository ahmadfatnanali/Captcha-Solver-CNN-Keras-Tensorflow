   ```
   After creating the virtual environment, activate it:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install required libraries:** Install the necessary libraries using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üîç Using the Application

To use the CAPTCHA solver, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your CAPTCHA images:** Place the images you want to solve in a specific directory.
2. **Run the application:** In the command line, input:
   ```
   python solve_captcha.py
   ```
3. **Input your directory:** When prompted, provide the path to the folder containing your CAPTCHA images.

The application will process the images and output the decoded text for each CAPTCHA.
